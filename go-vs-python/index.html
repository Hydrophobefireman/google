                <div class="header-s">Python is infamous for being slow</div>
                <div class="paras">
                    This however is untrue..The CPython implementation of compiling
                    to bytecode and running against a VM is slow..The PyPy implementation of python is much
                    faster because Manual memory management
                    (which is what CPython does with its counting) can be slower than automatic management in some
                    cases.
                    This and the Global Interpretor Lock (GIL) make Python threading a difficult task.
                </div>
                <div class="paras">Having worked on Python and its <span class="color-module">Threading</span> and
                    <span class="color-module">Multiprocessing</span> modules..it sure can be a tough task without
                    having domain specific knowledge.
                </div>
                <div class='header-s'>Enter GoLang</div>
                <div class="paras">A programming language designed by Google. With abilities to handle concurrent
                    programs (goroutines), make it perfect backend for event-based servers. Go was an attempt to bridge
                    the gap
                    between languages like Python and C internally in Google.</div>
                <div class="header-s">So Which One is Better?</div>
                <div class="paras">
                    The answer..depends. Go's typing discipline is strong,static while python is dynamically typed and
                    uses Duck Typing. "Type Hints" have been around since 3.5 and can be backported (like any PY3
                    feature) to python2 using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/typing/">Typing</a> module.
                    Python is an old language. It came around in the early 90s and emphasised code readability using
                    whitespaces.
                    <div class="paras"> Go on the other hand, first appeared 8 years ago.It had the advantage of
                        experienced Google
                        programmers who created a language tailored to handling millions of requests at any give time.
                        Thus, Go had the advantage of threading and asynchronous programming with ease
                    </div>
                    <div class="paras">But if Go was really THE better of the two, python would not be the most used
                        language at Google's <a href="https://github.com/google/">Github Page</a>.
                        This is because Python has evolved over the years to have multiple purposes..from being the
                        go-to language in data science to working on nifty scripts and automation..Python is often the
                        best choice.

                </div>
                <div class="header-s">So when to use What?</div>
                <div class="paras"><b>Let's Start with Go.</b>
                    <div class="paras">All is not perfect in the land of Go.Go completely ignores
                        most recent advances in programming languages in order to seem more similar to C.Go has some
                        very concrete design problems. Many of these were added on purpose, either to make the language
                        more like C or to make the implementation simpler</div>
                    <div class="paras">The way Go handles errors is weird.The
                        GoGet
                        method of including dependencies might seem convenient but. what if the maintainers include a
                        breaking change in their master branch?.Go lacks immutables and beautifully put in one article
                        <a href="http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2014/04/18/golang">Here</a>, go is
                        <b>not elegant as Python, not strong as Java.</b>

                        Go is a great language for Network Servers,Databases and places where you need multiple threads
                        and/or are handling thousands of requests at once. Python can be used in multiple places and
                        can decently handle servers as well. Python has an elegant easy-to-read syntax and is a good
                        choice for beginners too.Further,python has been a backend for larger websites too! Instagram
                        still runs on python</div>
